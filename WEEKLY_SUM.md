# Weekly Summary

[Progress Board](https://trello.com/b/I7HLyuhK)

## Week 3 - 11.02.2020 

- Add Custom Shh solver based on tutorial 1, no parameters tuned yet
- Add script to modify cell_type in vtp file by LBIBCell
- Add script to fit C0 for exponential decay
- taichi_lbibcell works with no CDESolver, boundary nodes detection and multiple cell support

## Week 2 - 26.10.2020 

- Add different BioSolver for division at random size and remove cells too close to wall
- Image segmentation for LBIBCell output (get summary stat. like CV)
- Get a better pictures of how LBIBCell work, still need to work on the boundary condition (no flux)
- Add a more systemic way to save the parameters involved, geometry and output (still need to include more later)

## Week 1 - 19.10.2020 

- Compile and run LBIBCell on bs-iber03
- Tried the tutorials
- Talked with Marco about the simulation routine
- Got a working [Docker image](https://github.com/wyq977/docker_images/blob/master/lbibcell/Dockerfile)
- Obtained some R/Matlab scripts from Marco
