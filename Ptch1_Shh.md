## From the nature communication paper

Shh signaling is initiated when the secreted ligand binds to the transmembrane receptor Ptch1.

Unliganded Ptch1 **Inhibits** the activity of a second transmembrane protein, Smo.

Smo controls the downstream modificaiton of Gli transcriptional efforts

## Shh signalling

At least during the earliest stages of
patterning, the amplitude of the Shh gradient increases at the
13
same time as pattern is elaborated

## Shh to receptor Ptch1 by mass action kinetics

The full model describes the binding of Shh to the receptor Ptch1 by mass action kinetics.

## MY TAKE

1. Shh producing at a exponential fashion (ligand) from cell of some type
2. Ptch1 are the receptor (transmembrane) (Fulfill the no-flux boundary condition)
3.
